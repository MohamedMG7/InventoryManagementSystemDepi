# Inventory Management System

## Project Overview

As digital commerce continues to expand, many small and medium-sized businesses face challenges in establishing efficient and comprehensive online sales platforms.

Such inefficiencies lead to operational delays, increased costs, and customer dissatisfaction.

This project proposes the development of a **web-based eCommerce and sales system** that provides businesses with an **all-in-one solution**. The platform focuses on:
- **Simplifying product management**
- **Streamlining order processing**
- **Enhancing customer satisfaction** through a smooth, intuitive shopping experience

By offering these integrated features, the system will help businesses optimize operations and maximize their online sales potential.
